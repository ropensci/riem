This package allows to get weather data from ASOS stations (airports)
via the great website of the [Iowa Environment
Mesonet](https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/request/download.phtml?network=IN__ASOS).

Installation
============

Install the package with:

``` r
install.packages("riem")
```

Or install the development version using
[devtools](https://github.com/r-lib/devtools) with:

``` r
library("pak")
pak::pak("ropensci/riem")
```

# Documentation

Please refer to the [`pkgdown` website](https://docs.ropensci.org/riem/) to read docs, in particular the [reference](https://docs.ropensci.org/riem/reference/index.html) and the [vignettes](https://docs.ropensci.org/riem/articles/index.html).

# Breaking changes in riem 1.0.0

The `latlon` argument of `riem_measures()` default to `FALSE`: 
you need to explicitly set it to `TRUE` for the latitude and longitude of the station to be included in the output.

The `date_start` and `station` no longer have default values.
